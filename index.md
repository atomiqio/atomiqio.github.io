        </span>
    </section>

    <p>Atomiq is an open-source Container-as-a-Service (<a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/containers-as-a-service-caas/">CaaS</a>)
    platform for managing and monitoring containerized applications,  microservices, and microservice workers as part
    of a unified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing">serverless computing</a> environment.
    It is based on the swarm mode features introduced with Docker 1.12, providing developers with
    a straightforward development strategy for building on these features without the need to stray from the
    core Docker ecosystem and adopt complex third party frameworks.</p>
