# atomiq.io

This is the repository of the website [atomiq.io](http://atomiq.io). It is hosted directly from the repository as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

## Local Setup

GitHub Pages websites being served through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you will need to replicate the setup on your local machine to preview the website locally.

[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your system, if you don't have them already.

Once installed, `cd` to the repository directory and run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), read up the docs if you need to go beyond basic Markdown in the doc files.

To understand the template system used by Jekyll, read up the [Liquid template engine docs](http://liquidmarkup.org/).

## Contributing

Feel free to make changes to the template files or the document files. The supporting docs are located in their respective directories, and the API docs are located under the `_includes` directory.
